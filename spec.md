# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add first/last name fields to the order form, remove the login button from the header, and add a contact email to the footer.

**Planned changes:**
- Add required "First Name" and "Last Name" input fields to the order form, positioned immediately before the shipping address fields, and include them in the order submission payload
- Remove the login/logout button from the header (both desktop and mobile menu)
- Add a clickable mailto link for `all4funflorida@gmail.com` at the bottom of the footer with a short prompt like "Questions? Email us at all4funflorida@gmail.com"

**User-visible outcome:** Customers filling out the order form will provide their first and last name before the shipping address, the header no longer shows a login button, and visitors can easily find and click the contact email at the bottom of every page.
