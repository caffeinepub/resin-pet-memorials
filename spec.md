## Summary
**Goal:** Update the resin memorial shape showcases so the heart contains a cat portrait, the hexagon contains a bird portrait, and all three animal portraits (heart, hexagon, square) are surrounded by a bold black frame inside the resin mold.

**Planned changes:**
- Generate a new heart-shaped resin memorial image featuring a cat portrait with a black frame, flowers, and grass decorations
- Generate a new hexagon-shaped resin memorial image featuring a bird portrait with a black frame, flowers, and grass decorations
- Generate a new square-shaped resin memorial image featuring a dog portrait with a black frame, flowers, and grass decorations
- Update the ShapeShowcases component to display the three newly generated memorial images

**User-visible outcome:** The three resin memorial shape cards on the site display updated images — a cat in the heart, a bird in the hexagon, and a dog in the square — each with a visible black frame around the animal portrait inside the mold.
