  "summary": "The diff shows that ShapeShowcases.tsx has been updated to include a Ponce headstone card referencing the new image path '/assets/generated/ponce-headstone-mold.dim_800x900.png', and no other shape cards were modified. However, the actual image file (ponce-headstone-mold.dim_800x900.png) does not appear in the diff as an added file, meaning REQ-1's image generation requirement may not be fulfilled by the diff evidence alone.",

      "reason": "The diff shows no added binary/image files. The 'ADDED FILES: none' entry confirms no new image asset was added in this diff. The image file at frontend/public/assets/generated/ponce-headstone-mold.dim_800x900.png is not present as an added file.",
