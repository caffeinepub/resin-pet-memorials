  "summary": "The diff modifies ShapeShowcases.tsx to reference the three new generated image paths and adds a black frame overlay via CSS box-shadow. However, the actual image files (whiskers-heart-memorial.dim_600x600.png, tweety-hexagon-memorial.dim_600x600.png, nabi-square-memorial.dim_600x600.png) are not present in the diff as added files. The black frame implementation uses an inset box-shadow overlay on the entire card image area rather than around the portrait within the resin mold.",
