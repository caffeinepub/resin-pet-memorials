## Summary
**Goal:** Rebrand the site from "Eternal Paws" to "Furever in Our Hearts" and update the hero gallery to display headstone-style memorials with nameplates for all three animals.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all "Eternal Paws" branding with "Furever in Our Hearts" throughout the site (header, footer, page title, all text references)
- Update top row of showcase to display headstone memorial designs for yorkie, bird, and cat
- Add nameplates to bottom of each headstone showing the animal's name (Nabi for yorkie, Tweety for bird, Whiskers for cat)

**User-visible outcome:** The site displays the new "Furever in Our Hearts" brand identity, and the hero gallery showcases three headstone memorials with grass, pebbles, and nameplates for each pet.
